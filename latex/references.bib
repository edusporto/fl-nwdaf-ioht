However, there is a lack of publicly available datasets reflecting cyberattacks on IoHT, mainly due to privacy concerns. This paper showcases the development of a dataset, ECU-IoHT, which builds upon an IoHT environment having different attacks performed that exploit various vulnerabilities. This dataset was designed to help the healthcare security community in analyzing attack behavior and developing robust countermeasures. No other publicly available datasets have been identified for cybersecurity in this domain. Anomaly detection was performed using the most common algorithms, and showed that nearest neighbor-based algorithms can identify attacks better than clustering, statistical, and kernel-based anomaly detection algorithms.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly integrated into daily life, particularly in healthcare, through the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). IoMT devices support services like continuous health monitoring but raise significant cybersecurity concerns due to their vulnerability to various attacks. The complexity and data volume of IoMT network traffic requires advanced methods to enhance security and reliability. Machine Learning (ML) offers techniques to detect, prevent, and mitigate cyberattacks. However, existing benchmark datasets lack essential features for robust IoMT security solutions, such as a reduced number of real devices, a limited variety of attacks, and a lack of extensive profiling. We propose a realistic benchmark dataset for IoMT security solutions development and evaluation to address these gaps. We executed 18 attacks on an IoMT testbed with 40 devices (25 real and 15 simulated), using protocols like Wi-Fi, MQTT, and Bluetooth. Supporting technologies, including dedicated network traffic collectors and a Faraday Cage, ensured data quality. The attacks fall into five categories: DDoS, DoS, Recon, MQTT, and spoofing. We aim to establish a baseline that complements existing datasets, aiding researchers in creating secure healthcare systems using ML. Beyond simulating attacks, we capture the lifecycle of IoMT devices from network entry to exit through profiling, allowing classifiers to identify device anomalies. The resulting CICIoMT2024 dataset, published on the CIC dataset page, demonstrates that various methods can classify IoMT cyberattacks. This effort supports new IoMT security solutions and contributes to the broader field of cybersecurity in healthcare, ensuring more reliable IoMT device deployment.},

	abstract = {Unlike traditional centralized machine learning, distributed machine learning provides more efficient and useful application scenarios. However, distributed learning may not meet some security requirements. For example, in medical treatment and diagnosis, an increasing number of people are using IoT devices to record their personal data, when training medical data, the users are not willing to reveal their private data to the training party. How to collect and train the data securely has become the main problem to be resolved. Federated learning can combine a large amount of scattered data for training, and protect user data. Compared with general distributed learning, federated learning is more suitable for training on scattered data. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning scheme that is based on the cryptographic primitive of homomorphic re-encryption, which can protect user data through homomorphic re-encryption and trains user data through batch gradient descent (BGD). In our scheme, we use the IoT device to encrypt and upload user data, the fog node to collect user data, and the server to complete data aggregation and re-encrypting. Besides, the security analysis and experimental results show that our scheme can complete model training while preserving user data and local models.},

year = {2025},
volume = {},
ISSN = {},
pages = {492-497},
abstract = { The Federated Learning (FL) approach in the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs) and adversarial attacks such as model poisoning, both of which threaten privacy and robustness. Model poisoning attacks compromise the global model by aggregating malicious client updates, while MIAs exploit information leakage during FL communication. Current techniques for FL robustness, such as adversarial training and differential privacy (DP) address these threats differently. DP provides the benefit of noise injection into gradients, ensuring privacy for data shared on a central aggregation server while maintaining a privacy-utility trade-off. However, it is not robust against model poisoning attacks on clients in a collaborative FL deployment within the IoHs. To address the challenges with the robustness of the DP, this work proposes a differentially private federated adversarial training (DP-FAT), integrating adversarial training with DP (DP-PGD and DP-FGSM). Using the ClaMP_Integrated-5184 dataset, proposed DP-FAT approach ensures a robust malware detection model while preserving privacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DP-FAT mitigates adversarial attacks and protects sensitive data during federated rounds, offering a scalable solution for secure IoHTs. Furthermore, privacy-utility trade-offs for DP- PGD reveal optimal Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP) guarantees, with configurations such as $(\alpha=3, \epsilon=6)$ or $(\alpha=2,\ \epsilon\in[5,7])$ effectively balancing robustness and privacy in IoHT malware detection systems. },

	abstract = {With the growing number of sensitive data transmit-ted in IT infrastructures, healthcare organizations and compa-nies that generate users' wearable data have become a target for attackers. To protect electronic healthcare data, Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) devices must be protected by robust Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to provide a secure environment. Since it is undesirable to collect this data and perform machine learning tasks directly, recently, to preserve users' privacy, federated learning has obtained attention from the government and healthcare organizations. Unlike the cen-tralized paradigm, federated learning is a privacy-aware machine learning framework designed to analyze data without sharing it. This paper proposes a deep neural network in federated learning (DNN-FL) to detect anomalies in the IoHT traffic that may result in security threats. We evaluate the detection performance of our proposal using metrics such as accuracy and precision. The proposed DNN-FL is validated using the wustl-ehms-2020 and ECU- IoHT datasets. It reached 91.40\% of accuracy in detecting attacks in the first dataset and 98.47\% in the second. All the developed source code in this work is being made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.},
